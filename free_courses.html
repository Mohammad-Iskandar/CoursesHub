OLD Course description:

No better time than now, and only increasing

With WordPress powering more than 25% of all websites in the world, there's never been a better time to build an income and a business around it.

You're here because you want to master WordPress, right? Good idea. You're in the right place. And, you can do it without learning any programming or coding.

While WordPress is open source, and because of that has thousands of developers building resources for it, it still takes quite a bit of learning to become a master at building and managing websites with it. It's not just learning the WordPress software, there's a small amount of graphic design knowledge needed, hosting and server management, troubleshooting broken sites or problems by hacking into the back end and server setup, and properly staging development environments around new sites or when performing updates and changes on existing sites.

"What a great course! Good explanation and a lot to learn, friendly and very quick support. I'm only at the beginning and I'll leave another review later after I finished this course. I'm sure there is much more to learn!" --Adriene

Why am I qualified to teach you?

Through this course, I'll teach you everything I've learned and mastered
through 10 years of building, managing, migrating, and hosting WordPress websites.

"He is concise and well spoken, without dumbing it down at all. As a total newbie to Wordpress, I'm thankful he's offering this! 3 lessons in and it's great so far." --Jamie Rasmussen

My business lets me work on my own schedule, manage my home workspace
without a boss or a manager, and gives me an unlimited ceiling for profit and income and time freedom.

Without learning to code or programming anything, I'm able to leverage what's already been done with WordPress to create modern, robust and functional websites for clients of all types.

I'm hoping you'll get to the same awesome place in your work life. Let this course give you the head start you need to increase your income fast.

"[Gregg] has covered more areas than what an average course would deliver, this is clear reflection of Greggs' experience in the subject. He has gone above and beyond to cover every aspect of WordPress for a clear and concise understanding for a beginner.

Gregg is probably one of the best instructors I have come across on Udemy and expert in the subject. Well done and Thank you for an amazing course."

--Mohamed Fawmey Mohamed Vinodh

Many of my best and biggest clients have come from "abandoned" WordPress websites, where the client's website designer or developer has left the scene. My ability to get in and restore, fix, redesign, and continue to manage WordPress websites brings me lots of instant and recurring income.

You'll learn how to do all this in 20 hours of easy-to-follow video content, fun lessons and challenges.

During this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to start or improve your own WordPress website business.

The WordPress Ecosystem

"Straight forward and neat! Just what I need to step up the freelancing ladder. Highly recommended." --Mr. Graciano Jose Reyes

It's probably no surprise to you that the WordPress community has thousands of really talented and creative developers, designers and technologists working within it. And you may know that much of their work is available as open-source resources that will enable you to build your own business.

The open-source philosophy doesn't mean that no one makes any money. On the contrary, by sharing much of what we, as a community, create, we all prosper much, much more, because we all share in expanding what's possible with WordPress.

By spending zero-to-little money, you can stand on the shoulders of those who came before you, to create your own business niche, by learning the skills and secrets presented in this course.

"Instructor explains everything very clearly, and in detail. So simple to learn and understand in this course. Looking forward to finishing all of the lessons with much excitement. An A+++ instructor and course." --Mekus

                        <p class="description" style="direction: ltr;">Get away from courses that take ages to finish and lose your interest in the middle. In this course, you will get a step-by-step guide to creating professional grade Android N apps, with a real-world case study. In the first section, we’ll create a strong architectural background for your app. You’ll be able to edit and customize the foundations of the app so it’s transferable between different projects. Then, you’ll learn the most productive ways to save and read data on Android with the Room framework, ObjectBox, and the Firebase database. The third section is about utilizing efficient data structures to maintain speed, even when the amount of data is huge. Finally, we’ll explore different ways to test Android applications such as: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The last section is about designing the front end of your app, including professional-level features, such as custom view development and explanatory user on boarding. Also, you’ll learn to upload your Android app to the Google Play store and discover advanced topics such as Payments, Android N Tiles, and voice interaction. By the end of the course, you’ll have the essential skills needed to build a real-world application.
